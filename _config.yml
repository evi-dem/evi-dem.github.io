The "EVIDEM – Evidence on Democracy and Markets Lab" is based at the University of Münster.
It brings together scholars from political science, economics, and history to investigate how political institutions, economic structures, and history shape contemporary societies.

Our research is united by a commitment to data-driven analysis of core questions at the center of contemporary policy debates. We seek to understand how political and economic forces interact across time and contexts, and how they shape people's lives.
